= Introduction =

This httpclient library aims to address shortcomings of urllib2, included in
the core Python (2.4/2.5) distribution, mainly:
  * its handling of proxy servers (especially HTTPS),
  * its handling of SSL/TLS certificate (lack of verification),
  * other HTTP methods (PUT, ...).


= Requirements =

This library will try to use Python's [http://docs.python.org/library/ssl.html ssl module], if available (Python 2.6). Otherwise, it will require the [http://pyopenssl.sourceforge.net/ PyOpenSSL library].

Please check the [Features] page for differences of feature and implementation.


= Design =

The design of these classes is loosely based on the [http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/ Apache HttpClient library (Java)].
